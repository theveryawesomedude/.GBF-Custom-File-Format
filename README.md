# .GBF-Custom-File-Format
note the fact that this is just for fun and only works like a .TXT file

and uhm yeah

HERE ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES YOU NEED
so for the dependencies you WILL need(installed via NPM (Node Package Manager))
npm install -g pkg
npm install winreg
AND
make sure you have node.js installed

AND NOW THE INSTRUCTIONS
so first you want to extract the .zip
AND
right click parser.exe
run it as administrator
you will see a cmd terminal pop up for a milisecond
and the file written as a .gbf file will be parsed into an actual file format
